Welcome to Broke, an open-source alternative to Brick that lets you experience minimalist smartphone use.
Inspired by Brick's mission to help users reduce distractions, Broke offers a streamlined approach to limiting your smartphone's functionality.

### Acknowledgments
While Broke is a fully functional app, if you find value in this concept and want a polished experience, consider supporting the original creators by purchasing Brick [here](https://getbrick.app/shop).

Out of respect to the original team, Broke is not available on the app store for download - I created it for open-source hobbists.
