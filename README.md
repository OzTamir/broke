Welcome to Broke, an open-source alternative to Brick that lets you experience minimalist smartphone use.
Inspired by Brick's mission to help users reduce distractions, Broke offers a streamlined approach to limiting your smartphone's functionality.

### Acknowledgments
While Broke is a fully functional app, if you find value in this concept and want a polished experience, consider supporting the original creators by purchasing Brick [here](https://getbrick.app/shop).

Out of respect to the original team, Broke is not available on the app store for download - I created it for open-source hobbists.

## Features
* Minimalist interface
* Open-source, customizable codebase
* Supports multiple profiles
* Allows creating a Broke-compatible tags (requires a physical tag)

## Creating a Broke tag
To create a tag, you need to get a physical NFC tag - any tag compatible with iOS will do the trick - I used an NTAG213.

I also created a 3D-printable model to carry tags around or stick them on the fridge - check it out [here](https://www.printables.com/model/983618-broke-tag-nfc-tag-cover-with-keychain-and-magnet-h).

Once you have a tag, you can use the interface of the Broke up to turn it into a tag - it will write a simple phrase that can be detected by the app to block/unblock.

## Getting Started
To use Broke, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository.
* Open the project in Xcode.
* Build and run the app on your iOS device.
